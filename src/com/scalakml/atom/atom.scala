/**
 * KML 2.2 supports new elements for including data about the author and related website in your KML file.
 * This information is displayed in geo search results, both in Earth browsers such as Google Earth,
 * and in other applications such as Google Maps. The ascription elements used in KML are as follows:
 * atom:author element - parent element for atom:name
 * atom:name element - the name of the author
 * atom:link element - contains the href attribute
 * href attribute - URL of the web page containing the KML/KMZ file
 * These elements are defined in the Atom Syndication Format.
 *
 * The <atom:author> element is the parent element for <atom:name>, which specifies the author of the KML feature.
 * @param name the name of the author
